<header> <h1> HTML and CSS Honors</h1></header>
<section><p> First there was looking at webpages. Then there was understanding. And now I am  excelling at making them.</p></section>
<article> <h3> What I made </h3><p> In this class I learned how to make basic to intermediate websites using HTML and CSS. I made various websites demonstrating my daily progress. In a few cases I created images with shapes I had managed to create through these two programming languages.</p>
 <h3> What I learned </h3> <p>In this class I learned how to hyperlink text and redirect the page to other external and internal webpages and or websites. I learned how to  appropriately style my webpages and add effects to them aswell. Positioning content and making shapes did trouble me at first, but after a few trials I managed to achieve my desired look. I also learned how to make online forms, use the transform property to alter the appearance of shapes and create shapes in 2D and 3D. I also learned the bootstrap property, how to add media and a tiny bit of JavaScript.</p>
<h3> What I enjoyed </h3><p>Out of everything I loved styling my webpages by adding effects. Making forms was an assignment I enjoyed. </p>
<h3>How I might use these skills in the future</h3> <p>I will definitely continue making webpages and websites in the future. In the future to come I am not sure how I will place my webpage making skills to practice, but I am positive that I will make websites for school.  Even before school starts, during this summer, I will be making webpages and websites over the summer for my summer homework assignments. During school, aside computer class, I will be making webpages for various school projects such as the science fair and final projects.</p>
