  Fallingwater or Kaufmann Residence is a house designed by architect Frank Lloyd
  Wright in 1935 in rural southwestern Pennsylvania, 43 miles (69 km) southeast of Pittsburgh.
  The home was built partly over a waterfall on Bear Run in the Mill Run section of Stewart Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania,
  in the Laurel Highlands of the Allegheny Mountains. The house was designed as a weekend home for the family of Edgar J. Kaufmann,
  owner of Kaufmann's department store.
