  <p class="about"><em>Hi!</em> I am Marian Bitsika. I am a  Greek-American, thirteen year old girl that lives in Athens, Greece. I attend ACS Athens and am a John Hopkins scholar. As I am an eighth grade student and graduated Middle School with an outstanding academic performance award in 7 out of 8 of my classes. At school I am part of three teams, two sports teams and debate. I have been a member of my school's volleyball team since 6th grade and this year I was team captain on the swimming team. I am fluent in two languages English and Greek and am currently learning Spanish.  </p>
  <p class="about"> In my free time I enjoy reading, playing sports and going to the movies. My favorite books are <em> The Hunger Games, </em> my favorite TV comedy series is <em> The Big Bang Theory </em> and my favorite movie is <em> The Life of Pi.</em> Since I am next to the sea I practice and compete in multiple water-sports such as kayaking, sailing, wind-surfing and swimming. An activity I like, but don't do very often, is to do escape rooms. I love to travel and hope someday to see all of the world's wonders. </p>
<p class="about"> <strong> P.S. </strong> Something a lot of people don't know about me is that I am afraid of pigeons. <em>(Pigeonphobia as my friends call it.)</em>
