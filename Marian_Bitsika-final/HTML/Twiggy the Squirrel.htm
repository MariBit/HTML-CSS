<section><h2> Animals have long been in showbiz, but Twiggy takes things to another level. Twiggy is a waterskiing gray squirrel
  who hits the road nine months of the year not only to entertain boating aficionados across North America, but also to
   promote water and boating safety.</h2></section>

   <article><p>Twiggy got her start back in 1978, when Chuck and Lou Ann
 Best found a squirrel blown out of its nest due to Hurricane David.
     Chuck had recently purchased a remote-control boat for the couple's
 daughter, and on a whim he taught the squirrel to waterski behind it.
     Suddenly in possession of a waterskiing squirrel, the couple began
hitting the boat-show circuit with the squirrel, whom they named Twiggy.
      As her fame increased, Twiggy began accepting offers to make guest
 appearances in movies, commercials and music videos.
      Two of her most famous credits are for her performances in
"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story," and "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
Burgundy.</p></article>

      Lou Ann continues rescuing and rehabilitating orphaned squirrels,
       training new Twiggys as needed. As of 2016, they're on the eighth generation.</p> </aside>
